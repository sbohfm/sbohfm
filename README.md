## You've found me (coding)!

⦾ Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not very much to see and... No! Don't go!

⦾ See, I **do** want to keep some **collaborative work** public and here and there, but chances **could be** I'm currently working in some equally important things right now. Things such as internship or academic research. Even with that, I'm the most *available to work FOR YOU* I might ever be in my career tho. Who knows, that's your chance.

⦾ Either way, I have a [Repl](https://replit.com/@sbohfm) too, notes about all things mildly interesting (for me), and mostly related to coding. This is the place you want to go to find study annotations, snippets, small projects, prototypes and drafts I might've forgotten. Small honest work.

⦾ On the other hand, this Github is the place where big stuff will live: guided, open source projects, event-related-tech / contests / challenges or relevant pieces from the said notebook! Hopefully everything stays more coherent this way...
