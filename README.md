## You've found me (coding)!

Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means ‚Äî not very much to see and... No! Don't go!

I- I **will** try to keep some **collaborative work public** here and there, but chances **could be** I'm currently working in some equally important things right now. Like internship or academic research. *And did I mentioned I'm very available to work **for you?***

Anyway, I have a [Repl](https://replit.com/@sbohfm) too -- as notebook for all things mildly interesting (for me) and mostly related to coding. That's the place you want to go to find study notes, small projects, prototypes and drafts I might've forgotten. On the other hand, this Github is the place where big stuff will live: guided, open source projects, event-related-tech/contests/challenges or relevant pieces from the said notebook!
