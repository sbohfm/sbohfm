## You've found me (coding)!

Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not very much to see but. But don't be upset just yet!

❗ Although **I will** try to keep some **collaborative work public** here and there, chances are **I'm currently working in some important stuff right now**. Like internship or academic research. *And did I mentioned I'm very available to work and **craving to be an/your intern?***

> Someone just hire me pls

📒 I use this as a notebook for all things mildly interesting (for me) and that are related to coding. That's the place you want to go to find things such as study notes, small projects, prototypes and drafts I might've forgotten. But here, on the other hand, is the place where big stuff will live, like guided, open source projects, event-related-stuff/contests or relevant pieces from the said notebook!

> Someone?

💸 If you think I could be (paid) fit, you're very **WELCOMED** to let me know! `Please.` You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrgcruz/), surely, but [e-mail](lucasrgcruz@gmail.com) is always the fastest option.

  > You can also find me other ways, like in a **more professional way**, or by checking some of my ***\~funny little codes\~*** but it's up to you!
