## You've found me (coding)!

◦ Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not very much to see and... No! Don't go!

◦ See, I **want** to keep some **collaborative work** public and here and there, but chances **could be** I'm currently working in some equally important things right now. Like internship or academic research, although I'm the most *available to work for you I've ever been but like.*

◦ Anyway, I have a [Repl](https://replit.com/@sbohfm) too, as notebook for all things mildly interesting (for me), and mostly related to coding. This is the place you want to go to find study notes, small projects, prototypes and drafts I might've forgotten. On the other hand, this Github is the place where big stuff will live: guided, open source projects, event-related-tech/contests/challenges or relevant pieces from the said notebook!
