## You've found me!

> Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means â€” not much to see I guess!

> Although I'll try to keep some collaborative work public here and there, chances are I'm currently working in something more important right now. Like internship matters or academic research. *Did I also say I'm available to work and **craving to be an/your intern?***

> Well, you read me, and if you think I could fit a (paid) role, you're more than welcomed to let me know! That'd be pretty sweet of yours and, you know, I'd fancy it **that** much, it's been tough. Anyway, you will surely find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrgcruz/), but [e-mail](lucasrgcruz@gmail.com) is always the fastest channel.

You can also find me other ways, like in a **more professional way**, or by reading some of my *\~funny little codes\~* but it's all up to you! ðŸ‘€
