## You've found me!

> Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not much to see I guess!

> Although I'll try to keep some collaborative work public here and there, chances are I'm currently working in something more important right now. Like internship matters or academic research. *And did I also say I'm available to work and **craving to be an/your intern?***

Dude, hire me pls.

> If you think I could fit a (preferably paid) role, you're MORE than WELCOMED to let me know! That'd be pretty sweet of yours and, you know, I'd fancy it **that** much, it's been rough. Anyway, you will surely find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrgcruz/), but [e-mail](lucasrgcruz@gmail.com) is always the fastest option.

You can also find me other ways, like in a **more professional way**, or by reading some of my *\~funny little codes\~* but it's on you!
