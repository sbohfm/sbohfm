## You've found me (coding)!

⦾ Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not very much to see and... No! Don't go!

⦾ See, I **want** to keep some **collaborative work** public and here and there, but chances **could be** I'm currently working in some equally important things right now. Like internship or academic research. Either way, I'm the most *available to work for you* I might ever be in my carrer tho. Who knows, that's your chance.

⦾ Anyway, I have a [Repl](https://replit.com/@sbohfm) too, notes about all things mildly interesting (for me), and mostly related to coding. This is the place you want to go to find study notes, small projects, prototypes and drafts I might've forgotten. Small honest work.

⦾ On the other hand, this Github is the place where big stuff will live: guided, open source projects, event-related-tech / contests / challenges or relevant pieces from the said notebook! Hopefully everything stays more coherent this way...
