## You've found me (coding)!

Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not very much to see but. But don't be upset just yet!

Although **I will** try to keep some **collaborative work public** here and there, chances are **I'm currently working in some important things right now**. Like internship or academic research. *And did I mentioned I'm very available to work and **craving to be an/your intern?***

> Someone just hire me pls

You see, I'm very active in my Replit channel, since I use it as a notebook for all things mildly interesting (for me) and that are related to coding. That's the place you want to go to find things such as study notes, small projects, prototypes and drafts I might've forgotten.

Here, on the other hand, is the place where big stuff will live, like guided, open source projects, event-related/competitions or relevant pieces from my notebook!

So, if you think I could fit a (preferably paid) role, you're **MORE** than **WELCOMED** to let me know! That'd be pretty sweet of yours and I'd fancy it **that** much, it's been rough lately. Anyway, you will surely find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrgcruz/), but [e-mail](lucasrgcruz@gmail.com) is always the fastest option.
