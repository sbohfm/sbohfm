## You've found me (coding)!

Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not very much to see and... No! Don't go!

❗ I- I **will** try to keep some **collaborative work public** here and there, but chances **could be** I'm currently working in some equally important things right now. Like internship or academic research. *And did I mentioned I'm very available to work and **to be your intern?***

> Someone just hire me pls

📒 But I have a [Repl](https://replit.com/@sbohfm) too -- as notebook for all things mildly interesting (for me) related to coding. That's the place you want to go to find study notes, small projects, prototypes and drafts I might've forgotten. On the other hand, this Github is the place where big stuff will live: guided, open source projects, event-related-tech/contests/challenges or relevant pieces from the said notebook! They're related in some sense.

> Someone?

💸 If you think I could help, you're **WELCOMED** to let me know! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrgcruz/), surely, but [e-mail](lucasrgcruz@gmail.com) is always the fastest option.

  > You can find me other ways, like in a **more professional way**, or by checking some of my ***\~funny little codes\~*** but it's up to you!
