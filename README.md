## You've found me (coding)!

Hey, this is my personal Github, and you're probably familiar with what it means — not very much to see!

Although **I will** try to keep some **collaborative work public** here and there, chances are **I'm currently working in some important things right now**. Like internship or academic research. *And did I mentioned I'm very available to work and **craving to be an/your intern?***

> Someone just hire me pls

So, if you think I could fit a (preferably paid) role, you're **MORE** than **WELCOMED** to let me know! That'd be pretty sweet of yours and I'd fancy it **that** much, it's been rough. Anyway, you will surely find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasrgcruz/), but [e-mail](lucasrgcruz@gmail.com) is always the fastest option.

> You can also find me other ways, like in a **more professional way**, or by checking some of my ***\~funny little codes\~*** but it's on you!
